# Generic Look Up

This is a simple and configurable generic component that takes as an input the search term and the object name, 
it then displays a search bar from which the user can search and add the desired objects to a list.

Once the user selects or removes an object from his selection, an event is fired to the parent component 
with the list of the selected names.
You can also choose to enable multi selection.
You are free to customize the component with the desired icon name.
